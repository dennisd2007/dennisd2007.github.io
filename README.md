My Github account is source control and collaborative software I am able to see changes to tell people that my work is my own.
The repository I made has a README.md file which is where im typing in right now once im done typing I can pull it up to my repository to see it.
I made my repository on Github then went into Github Desktop to clone my repository by clicking file, clone, and finding my new repository I created.
